What if tomorrow, hundreds, thousands, or even more people start sending 100,000 packets per second into the network using high speed probing? It is reasonable to think that this would not be a desirable scenario for the Internet. However, this might already be taking place, as high speed probing techniques such as ZMap and Yarrp, the high speed evolution of Ping and Traceroute, are extensively used by the network research community and beyond.</description></item></channel></rss>
