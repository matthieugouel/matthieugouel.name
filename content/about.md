Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently a Systems Engineer working at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), France. 

I completed my PhD at [Sorbonne UniversitÃ©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in 2023.   
My [doctoral work](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04164622v1/document) is centered on advancing our understanding of the internet infrastructure, achieved through the application of internet-wide high-speed measurements and extensive large-scale analysis. Broadly speaking, my research contributes to addressing challenges across diverse research domains, including network topology and performance, network security, and traffic engineering.

Previously, I held positions as a Software Engineer at the [French Ministry for the Armed Forces](https://www.defense.gouv.fr) and as a DevOps Engineer at [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en).
